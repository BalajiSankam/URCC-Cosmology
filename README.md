## 📄 Abstract

This repository contains my original research paper proposing a novel cosmological framework called the **Unified Rotational Collapse-Origin Cosmology (URCC)**. Unlike the conventional Big Bang theory, URCC suggests the universe began from a **collapse of pre-existing cosmic dust**, leading to:

- Faster-than-light gravity formation
- Rotational gravitational expansion
- Delayed emergence of light
- Multiverse-compatible structure

The theory introduces equations and diagrams explaining how **gravity precedes light**, and how **rotational collapse** shapes the universe.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

1. **Collapse before light** – Gravity forms only when cosmic dust exceeds a threshold density  
2. **Gravity spreads faster than light** – A structural force shaping space itself  
3. **Rotational expansion** – Not a balloon-like explosion, but a spinning gravitational scaffold  
4. **Light emerges later** – Only after gravity shapes the structure  
5. **Multiverse logic** – Rotational imbalances can spawn new universes  
6. **Central core hypothesis** – A cosmic gravitational anchor, possibly a giant black hole

## ⚙️ Mathematical Framework

Four original equations cover:

- Collapse-triggered gravity formation  
- Superluminal gravity spread  
- Orbital radius expansion from rotation  
- Light generation from gravity threshold  

Mapped against:
- Einstein Field Equations  
- Newtonian orbital mechanics  
- Friedmann expansion model  
- Radiation physics
